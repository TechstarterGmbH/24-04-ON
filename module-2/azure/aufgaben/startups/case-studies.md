### Task Breakdown with Current Frame and Constraints  

1. **Build Infrastructure Manually**  
   - Use the Azure portal to manually set up the required resources:  
     - **Virtual Machines (VMs)** for hosting applications or running tasks.  
     - **Function Apps** to handle serverless business logic.  
     - **Storage Accounts** for **Blob Storage** (file storage), **Queue Storage** (message queue), and **Table Storage** (structured data).  

2. **Implement Business Logic with Code**  
   - Write the logic for the **Function App** to perform tasks like processing data from **Queue Storage**, storing results in **Table Storage**, and interacting with **Blob Storage** as needed.  
   - If applicable, design code that interacts with the VMs, such as sending tasks or triggering actions.

3. **Automate Infrastructure Deployments (Infrastructure as Code)**  
   - Use an **ARM Template** to replicate the manually created infrastructure in a consistent, repeatable manner.  
   - Ensure the ARM template deploys the VM, Function Apps, and Storage resources (Blob, Queue, and Table) with appropriate configurations.

### Constraints  
- Use only the following Azure services:  
  - **Virtual Machines (VMs)** for compute tasks.  
  - **Function Apps** for serverless business logic.  
  - **Blob Storage** for unstructured data.  
  - **Queue Storage** for task queuing.  
  - **Table Storage** for structured data.  

This ensures alignment with the specified constraints while maintaining a logical progression from manual setup to automation.

### Scenario 1: Serverless Image Processing Pipeline
Your team works for a photography startup, PixelPerfect. The company wants to provide customers with resized images for social media. As part of the engineering team, you’ve been tasked with setting up a pipeline where users can upload images to a storage system, which will then be resized automatically and made available for download. The CTO expects a scalable and cost-effective serverless solution.

### Scenario 2: Task Queue with Azure Queue Storage
You’re part of a logistics company, QuickShip. The company needs a system to process incoming shipment requests. Each request is placed in a queue, and a background process handles them one by one to ensure no request is missed. Your manager has asked you to implement a system using Queue Storage and Function Apps to automate this task processing. You need to ensure it scales during peak hours when shipment requests flood in.

### Scenario 3: Scalable Web App Backend
Your client, BookBerry, is a startup building a book review platform. They need a backend system to store user profiles and reviews. The system must be lightweight and capable of scaling quickly with demand. The team decided to use a Function App for APIs and Table Storage for structured data storage. You’ve been tasked with implementing the backend, ensuring it's efficient and scalable.

### Scenario 4: Automating VM Maintenance
Your company, EcoCompute, is keen on reducing energy costs. They run a resource-heavy application on a VM that’s only needed during business hours. The IT team has asked you to implement a solution where the VM automatically starts at 8 AM and shuts down at 6 PM daily. Using a Function App and an ARM template, you’ll create and automate this process, showing the CFO how much money they’ll save.

### Scenario 5: Video Content Distribution System
You’re working with EduStream, an online learning platform that hosts thousands of instructional videos. To optimize storage and delivery, they want to store videos in Blob Storage and integrate a Function App that transcodes videos into multiple resolutions. Additionally, you’ll configure lifecycle management to archive older videos and set up a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to ensure fast global delivery.
